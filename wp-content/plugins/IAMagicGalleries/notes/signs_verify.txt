To assure that the data has not been tampered with and to ensure its authenticity, you can implement digital signatures using public key cryptography. Below are the general steps to implement this for your scenario:

### Server-Side (PHP):

The first server (origin) will digitally sign the data with its private key before sending it to the intermediary server. The intermediary server will then send this signed data on request to the client (browser).

1. **Sign the data using OpenSSL in PHP**:
   ```php
   $data = 'Your data here'; // This is the data you want to send

   // Load your private key from a file
   $privateKey = openssl_pkey_get_private('file://path/to/private_key.pem');

   // Create a signature
   $signature = '';
   openssl_sign($data, $signature, $privateKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);

   // Encode the signature in a format that can be transported easily, e.g., Base64
   $encodedSignature = base64_encode($signature);

   // Send both data and signature to the intermediary server
   // You might store it in a database, send it over a network, etc.
   // The storage/transmission mechanism is not covered here
   ```
2. **Provide the public key**:
   Make sure that the public key corresponding to the private key used for signing is accessible to the client in a secure way.

### Intermediary Server:

The intermediary server will serve the data and the signature without modifying them. It only acts as a storage and forwarding mechanism, so no special cryptographic action is required on this server.

### Client-Side (JavaScript):

When the client (browser) requests the data from the intermediary server, it receives both the data and the signature. It needs to verify the signature using the public key.

1. **Fetch the data and the signature**:
   ```javascript
   // Fetch the data and the signature from the intermediary server
   // This assumes you have some endpoint that returns a JSON object with data and signature
   fetch('https://intermediary-server/endpoint')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(({ data, signature }) => {
       const dataArray = new TextEncoder().encode(data);
       const signatureArray = Uint8Array.from(atob(signature), c => c.charCodeAt(0));

       // Continue with the verification process below
     });
   ```

2. **Use SubtleCrypto for verification**:
   ```javascript
   (async function verifySignature(dataArray, signatureArray, publicKey) {
     try {
       // Import the public key
       const cryptoKey = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
         'spki', // Use 'spki' for public key import or 'pkcs8' for private key
         str2ab(atob(publicKey)), // Base64-decoded public key in ArrayBuffer format
         {
           name: "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5",
           hash: { name: "SHA-256" },
         },
         true,
         ["verify"]
       );

       // Verify the signature
       const isValidSignature = await crypto.subtle.verify(
         {
           name: "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5",
         },
         cryptoKey,
         signatureArray,
         dataArray
       );

       if (isValidSignature) {
         console.log('Signature is valid, data has not been tampered with.');
         // You can safely use the data here
       } else {
         console.error('Invalid signature, data may have been tampered with.');
         // Handle the situation where the data cannot be trusted
       }
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Verification failed', error);
     }
   })(dataArray, signatureArray, publicKey); // Call the function with the fetched data, signature, and public key

   function str2ab(str) {
     const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(str.length);
     const bufferView = new Uint8Array(buffer);
     for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
       bufferView[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
     }
     return buffer;
   }
   ```

Please note that the above code snippets are provided as guidelines, you might need to adjust them for your specific use case, including how data is transferred between the different servers and how you handle exceptions and errors.

Also, keep in mind that while this method ensures the integrity and authenticity of the data being sent, it does not provide confidentiality. If confidentiality is also a requirement, consider encrypting the data before sending it to the intermediary server.

***********

The method of distributing the public key to the client depends on the security requirements of your application and the threat model you are working with. Here are a few approaches you can take:

1. **Hardcoding in the JS Library**:
   - Pros: Simple, no extra requests needed, and no latency introduced.
   - Cons: If the key needs to be rotated or updated, you must update all client libraries, which might not be practical.

2. **Served Dynamically by Your Server**:
   - Pros: The key can be updated server-side, and clients will always get the current key.
   - Cons: Adds a point of failure if the key-serving endpoint is not accessible or compromised. The key distribution itself should be secured.

3. **Including in the Web Application Payload**:
   - Pros: The key is bundled with the initial secure page load; updates to the key can be managed as part of normal web application updates.
   - Cons: Similar to serving dynamically but less flexible since an application release is needed for key rotation.

4. **Served through a Secure API**:
   - Pros: Can provide the latest keys with proper access controls, ensures that only authenticated and authorized clients receive the key.
   - Cons: Requires additional infrastructure to secure and manage the API.

5. **Certificate Pinning**:
   - Pros: Can verify the key against a known certificate, adding an extra layer of security.
   - Cons: Complex to implement and manage; improper handling can lead to connectivity issues.

6. **Including Key Information in a Well-Known Location**:
   - Pros: Follows a standard practice; for instance, keys can be placed in `.well-known` directory or a DNS record (like for DKIM).
   - Cons: It's not as direct as the other methods and could be less intuitive for implementers.

To ensure security, any exchange of the public key should happen over a secure channel, typically HTTPS. If the public key is served by an endpoint, that endpoint should be secured in the same way your other endpoints are protected.

Here is an example of how you might serve the public key dynamically in PHP:

```php
// This would be a dedicated endpoint for fetching the public key
header('Content-Type: application/json');

$publicKey = file_get_contents('path/to/public_key.pem');
$publicKeyForTransport = base64_encode($publicKey);

echo json_encode(['publicKey' => $publicKeyForTransport]);
```

And on the client side, you would fetch this key when needed (with proper error handling):

```javascript
fetch('/path/to/public-key-endpoint')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(({ publicKey }) => {
    // Use the fetched public key for signature verification
    // ...
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching the public key:', error);
  });
```

For most applications, a combination of serving the key dynamically and including it in the web application payload is both secure and practical. It ensures that the public key can be updated as needed and reduces the risk associated with hardcoding the key in multiple places. Just be aware that any time you are distributing cryptographic keys, even public ones, you should ensure the integrity and authenticity of the distribution mechanism itself.

***********

When storing a public key in JavaScript, you typically want a balance between readability, compatibility, and ease of use with Web Crypto APIs. Since you'll likely use the SubtleCrypto interface for cryptographic operations in the browser, it's convenient to store the public key in a format that is easily usable by this API.

One common and convenient format to store public keys in JavaScript is Base64-encoded DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format. This format is compact and easily transferable as a string. It is also simple to convert to and from binary formats needed for cryptographic operations.

Here is an example of how to store and use a Base64-encoded public key in JavaScript:

Storing the key:
```javascript
// This is your Base64-encoded public key, possibly provided by your server.
const base64PublicKey = 'MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG...'; // shortened for clarity
```

Using the key (with Web Crypto API):
```javascript
(async function() {
    // Decode the Base64 public key to an ArrayBuffer.
    const publicKeyBuffer = Uint8Array.from(window.atob(base64PublicKey), c => c.charCodeAt(0)).buffer;

    // Import the public key into the SubtleCrypto API.
    const cryptoKey = await window.crypto.subtle.importKey(
        'spki', // the format: 'spki' for public keys
        publicKeyBuffer, // the public key in ArrayBuffer format
        {
            name: 'RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5', // algorithm name
            hash: { name: 'SHA-256' }, // hashing algorithm for signature verification
        },
        true, // the key is extractable
        ['verify'] // the usages of the key
    );

    // Use the imported public key for verification, encryption, etc.
})();
```

For the `importKey` method, the `'spki'` parameter signifies that we're using the Subject Public Key Info format, which is a common format for transmitting public keys.

To ensure the key's integrity, you may want to store the corresponding fingerprint or hash of the key alongside the key itself, either hard-coded in the JS or fetched from a secure location. This way, you can verify that the key has not been altered before using it.

Remember, when it's stored in JS, especially if you include it in a publicly accessible file, anyone can read this key. This is not inherently a security issue since it's a public key (meant to be public), but it's still important to protect the key from tampering or unauthorized updates by serving it over HTTPS and using good security practices in your server environment.
