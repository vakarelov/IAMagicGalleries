`add_action('activate_plugin', ...)` and `register_activation_hook(...)` are two different ways to hook into the activation process of a WordPress plugin, but they serve slightly different purposes and have some key differences:

1. `add_action('activate_plugin', ...)`

   - This is a more flexible method that allows you to attach a custom action when a plugin is activated.
   - You can specify a custom callback function to run when the activation occurs.
   - It doesn't have to be limited to just displaying notices; you can perform various tasks during activation.
   - You can use it to handle activation-related actions for both single-site and network (multisite) WordPress installations.

   Example:
   ```php
   add_action('activate_plugin', 'my_custom_activation_function', 10, 2);
   ```

2. `register_activation_hook(...)`

   - This is a specific WordPress function designed for plugin activation hooks.
   - It is a simpler and more specialized way to execute code when a plugin is activated.
   - It is typically used to perform setup tasks that should only occur during the plugin's initial activation.
   - It is specific to single-site installations and doesn't work for network (multisite) installations.

   Example:
   ```php
   register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'my_custom_activation_function');
   ```

In summary, `register_activation_hook()` is used for handling tasks that are specific to the activation of your plugin and is generally simpler to implement. On the other hand, `add_action('activate_plugin', ...)` provides more flexibility and can be used for a wider range of actions during activation. The choice between them depends on the complexity of the activation process and whether your plugin needs to support multisite installations. For most cases, `register_activation_hook()` is sufficient for handling activation-related tasks.
